Review results for portfolio.html (from branch develop)
The HTML file presents a visually appealing layout for a personal portfolio but lacks essential functionality as per the specified requirements. Notably, the button elements for "Download resume" and "See my work" should explicitly define their types to prevent default behaviors. Additionally, certain width styles are missing units, which can cause layout issues. The spacing in the software skills section could be improved for consistency by using `<span>` elements. Moreover, the video autoplay feature may hinder user experience; adding controls would enhance usability. Finally, an unnecessary commented `<div>` in the project section should be cleaned up to avoid confusion. Implementing these changes will greatly improve both functionality and user experience.
